# CellCenterModel

This is a program for a cell-centered model that represents the three-dimensional morphogenesis of a monolayer.

## how to make and run ##
Parameter files (parameters.hpp) for the three patterns are included in each directory.

When executing, place one of them in the same hierarchy as the makefile.
Then execute the following code.

    make
    . /a.out




Any published work which utilizes this code shall include the following reference:
